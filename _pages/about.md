In my spare time I play hockey and dodgeball, create pottery through Toronto's Gardiner Museum in-house pottery classes, cook, and have an occasional beer with friends. 

I graduated from York University with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in 2015, and Loyalist College with a Paramedic Diploma in 2018. My passion lies in creative thinking and problem solving my way through daily life. I am methodical, imaginative, self-starter who often spends time wondering about questions like: 
* Does warm weather correlate to higher outbreak numbers of COVID-19? 
* What countries win the most Olympic medals, comparing Winter to Summer games, and what are some potential reasons for this? 
* Does budget size correlate to call volume in Toronto Emergency Services? 
* Can we accurately determine when El Ni√±o weather patterns occurred in North America by examining the temperature trends in historical weather data? 

This passion lead me to my current career tragectory of landing a data analyst role so I can apply my innate curiosity with data driven results to a wide variety of topics.

Of course, it has to be Hello World, right?
