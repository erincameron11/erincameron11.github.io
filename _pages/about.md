In my spare time you'll find me playing hockey or dodgeball, reading, creating pottery, cooking, travelling, or having an occasional beer with friends. 

I am a Computer Science student, set to graduate in December 2023, with a deep interest in the Cyber Security, Data Analytics, and Web Development fields. My passion lies in creative thinking and problem solving my way through daily life. I am a methodical, imaginative, self-starter and often catch myself thinking about questions like: 
* Does budget size correlate to call volume in Toronto Emergency Services? 
* What countries win the most Olympic medals, comparing Winter to Summer games, and what are some potential reasons for this? 
* Does warm weather correlate to higher outbreak numbers of COVID-19? 
* Can we accurately determine when El Ni√±o weather patterns occurred in North America by examining the temperature trends in historical weather data? 

This passion lead me to my current career tragectory, so I can apply my innate curiosity with data driven results to a wide variety of topics.
