In my spare time you'll find me playing hockey or dodgeball, reading, creating pottery, cooking, travelling, or having an occasional beer with friends. 

I am a Computer Science enthusiast, with an interest in Web Development, Data Analytics and Cyber Security. My passion lies in creative thinking and problem solving my way through daily life. I am a methodical, imaginative, self-starter and often catch myself thinking about questions like: 
* Does budget size correlate to call volume in Toronto Emergency Services? 
* What countries win the most Olympic medals, comparing Winter to Summer games, and what are some potential reasons for this? 
* Does warm weather correlate to higher outbreak numbers of COVID-19? 
* Can we accurately determine when El Niño weather patterns occurred in North America by examining the temperature trends in historical weather data? 

This passion lead me to my current career tragectory, so I can apply my innate curiosity with data driven results to a wide variety of topics.
