Various Python programs created to practice coding in the Python language.

## Introduction
Used Python to solve four categories of programs:
* simple programs
* sorting algorithms
* searching algorithms
* data structures


## Technologies
These applications were built with the following technology:
* Python
* Jupyter
* conda
