A jQuery application using front-end technologies for accepting or denying a Valentine.

## Introduction
A silly classic `will-you-be-my-valentine` application that allows a user to easily select `Yes` to the question. The `No` option quickly evades the cursor and becomes extremely difficult to select.   

The aim of this project is to use CSS and HTML to design a front-end UI of a Valentine, and animate it using jQuery. When a user clicks the `Yes` button, the button morphs into a heart. If a user attempts to select the `No` option, the button moves quickly away from the cursor.

## Technologies
This application was built with the following technology:
* JavaScript - jQuery
* HTML
* CSS 
  

## Implementation
The application was implemented in Visual Studio Code.  

HTML and CSS were used for front-end styling of the Valentine, and animation. jQuery was used to accept cursor input from the users mouse. This input was then used to evade the cursor with the `No` button.   

  
Below is an image of the alert displayed when a user successfully clicks on the `No` button.
